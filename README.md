blackjack
=========

Multi-player Black Jack game written in HTML5 and JavaScript. 


User on the right side of the game can play. However, score is updated only once. 
User has to click "Restart" to create a new game because of which the game can
only keep track of the user's balance once. Hitting "Reset" resets everything 
including balance of the user. I will upload the code one I fix the problem.
