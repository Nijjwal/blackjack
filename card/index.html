<!--  Please read this first for running the game!

Since the programming part is entirely written on javascript, 
please enable javascript in your browser.!

Please use Google Chrome to test the single user game
with the console running. I have not written code for
the player on the left hand side. Please use buttons
that are on the right hand side of the game. 

To run the game follow these steps:
a. Open the index.html file of the game in 'Google Chrome'
b. Rt. click anywhere on the screen and click on the option
   'Inspect Element'
c. Then click on 'Console' tab. Now start using buttons 
   on the Black Jack Desk.
d. I have not written code for the player on the left hand
   side. Please use buttons that are on the right hand side 
   of the game. 
   Place a minimum bet and start playing the game. 
   All the cards provided to the dealer and the player2,
   score and other additional detail like who won or lost
   are updated in console as the game progresses.


   Bug:
   1) Both dealer and a player can handle 10 cards at most
   without getting their individual total score over 21. 
   Four Aces total = 4
   Four num 2 cards total =  8
   Three num 3 cards total = 6
                       Total score: 18
   _______________________
       Total num of cards used = Four + Four + Three = 11

   Whenever the browser draws more than one card at a time
   for the dealer, some pictures overlap. This is one bug
   that needs to be fixed. 

   2) Dealer hidden card number is displayed in console.
   The card number (not a Black Jack value) of first two 
   dealer cards are shown in console, this is just for 
   my reference. Second card in the interface remains hidden. 
   Do not cheat!

   3)Balance function is not complete!

   Thanks, enjoy the game.
